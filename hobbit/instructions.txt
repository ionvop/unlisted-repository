Create a partial program's algorithm
- Greet the customer
- Ask for the services that they want to order. This query will be repeated until the customer decides that they have enough.

- Then, they may revise their order. Removing or reducing the amount that they ordered.
- The program must be able to take track of the amount that the customer orders. This will be recorded in a separate text file.

- When the time comes for the program to calculate shipping prices, it will open a dictionary or list of the shipping prices for each country.
- The string method will be for charm, we will lowercase inputs from the customer to standardize their responses.

- Ask for the customer's personal information (name, phone number, address)
- Display the receipt
